# SHAREOK DSpace Source

This repository is based on the 5.x binary release of DSpace and contains configuration and custom code for the SHAREOK repository. 


## Dev Workflow Notes test

* `5.x` is the current production branch and should be maintained as a deployable branch at all times.
* Open a new feature branch for development, prefixed with `dev-` and named to indicate the project or ticket that you're working on. For example, `dev-README` or `dev-RM-91-shareok-banner`. 
* Once your changes are tested and ready for review, open a GitHub pull request against the 5.x branch.
* Delete feature branches once they have been merged.
* When code is deployed to production, create a version tag to document the release.
