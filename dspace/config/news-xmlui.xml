<head>SHAREOK Repository</head>

<p>SHAREOK is the joint institutional repository for the University of Oklahoma Libraries (OU) and Oklahoma State University Libraries (OSU). It serves as the home for the intellectual output of both communities, and will ultimately include digital dissertations, faculty publications, digital special collections, open access publications, open educational resources and much more.</p>

<p>If you would like to place your works in the institutional repository, please read the  <xref target="static/OU_OSU_IR_Policies_V5.pdf"> Policies and Guidelines</xref> document and then contact your library: <xref target="/feedback">OU</xref> or <xref target="http://www.library.okstate.edu/about/contact-us">OSU</xref>. Digital assets placed in the repository are available to a global audience, and search engine optimization techniques are used to increase their visibility to researchers and thus their impact on the global community.</p>
